create tool "main" with ok;
	"a" is a number.
	"b" is a number.
	"c" is a number.
	"a" is 100.
	"b" is 50.
	"c" is "a" plus "b".
	show me "c".
	"c" is "a" minus "b".
	show me "c".
	"c" is "a" times "b".
	show me "c".
	"c" is "a" divided by "b".
	show me "c".
	"c" is "a" modulo "b".
	show me "c".
	i'm thinking that "a" is 4.
	i'm thinking that "b" is 2.
	i'm thinking that "c" is 7 times a plus b.
	i'm thinking that show me "c".
